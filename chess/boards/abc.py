        Create a new board from given data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        board : list[list[int]]
            A 2-dimensional list (list of lists) of integers, representing a specific
            board position. Each sub-list corresponds to a rank (row) on the board,
            ordered from 1 to 8, and has 8 elements (integers), each corresponding to
            a square on that rank, ordered from a to h. For example, `board[0][1]`
            corresponds to the square on first row (rank) and second column, i.e. b1.
            The data for each square is an integer from -6 to +6, where
            0: empty, 1: pawn, 2: knight, 3: bishop, 4: rook, 5: queen, 6: king
            White pieces are denoted with positive integers, while black pieces have the
            same magnitude but with a negative sign.
        castling_stats : list[list[int]]
            Castling availability for white and black, as a 2-dimensional list of integers.
            Each sub-list contains two integers, representing availability of the kingside
            and queenside castling, respectively. The first sub-list corresponds to white,
            and the second sub-list ro black. Integers are either 1 (castling allowed) or 0.
        turn : int
            The player who should play first, where +1 is white and -1 is black.
        fifty_move_count : int
            Number of plies (half-moves) since the last capture or pawn advance, used for
             the fifty-move-draw rule; if the number reaches 100, the game ends in a draw.
        enpassant_file : int
            The file (column) index (from 0 to 7), in which an en passant capture is allowed
            for the current player in the current move. Defaults to -1 if no en passant allowed.
        ply_count : int
            The number of plies (half-moves) from the beginning of the game. Starts at 0.
